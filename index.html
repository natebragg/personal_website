                <p>I am a PhD student in the
                  <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>
                  at <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a>, working on
                  programming languages with my advisors
                  <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster">Jeff Foster</a> and
                  <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~kfisher">Kathleen Fisher</a>.</p>
                <p>My primary research interests are related to Program Synthesis,
                  applications of Convex Optimization, and Resource Analysis.</p>
                <p>I'm also generally into weird type systems, event-driven systems,
                  distributed systems, and machine learning.</p>

                <p>My current work is currently under review for publication.<p>
                <p>Take a look at some of my past projects:<p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/natebragg/ratl">Ratl</a>, a
                    mini-scheme with a resource-aware type system based on
                    <a href="http://raml.co/">RaML</a>, by Hoffmann et. al.
                    It is written in Haskell, and is meant as a sandbox to
                    play with resource-aware types, in order to explore their
                    concrete applications.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/smudgelang/smudge">Smudge</a>,
                    a domain-specific language for event-driven state machines,
                    along with a compiler and run time system, co-created with
                    my colleague <a href="https://nmichaels.org/">Nathan Michaels</a>.
                    The compiler is written in Haskell, and generates ANSI C89
                    output.  The run time system, Smear, is written in C99.</li>

                <p>Since summer 2019, I have been funded thanks to the generous support of the
                  <a href="https://www.draper.com/careers/fellow-program">Draper Fellows</a> program.</p>
                <p>In the spring 2019, I was an RA for professor
                  <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/">Jeff Foster</a>.</p>
                <p>In the spring and fall of 2018, I was a graduate TA for
                  <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/">Comp 105: Programming Languages</a>
                  with professor <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/">Norman Ramsey</a>.</p>
                <p>Before returning to graduate school, I spent 12 years in
                  industry working on cool stuff like embedded systems and machine learning
                  for companies including <a href="https://www.bose.com/">Bose</a> and
                  <a href="https://adbsafegate.com/product-center/airfield">ADB Airfield Solutions</a>.</p>
                <p>Before that, I got my BS in Electrical Engineering at
                  <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>.</p>
